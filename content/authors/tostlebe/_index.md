Dr. Tostlebeâ€™s research focuses on three main issues: (1) the application and elaboration of criminological 
theory to the landscapes of institutional corrections and reentry, (2) criminal justice system responses 
to incarcerated and previously incarcerated individuals, and (3) exploring the intersection of social 
influences and individual characteristics and how they independently and interactively impact illicit 
activity both in custodial settings and post-release. Dr. Tostlebe's current project--funded by Sherwood Foundation--centers 
on establishing the processes and procedures of an Omaha-based reentry house. She serves on the editorial 
board of *Corrections*. Her research has appeared in outlets such as *Criminology*, *Journal of Research in 
Crime and Delinquency*, *Health & Justice*, *Homicide Studies*, and *Preventive Medicine*.
